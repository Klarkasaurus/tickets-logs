Date: "7-12-2025 19:05"
TicketID: "020"
Title: "Can't access mapped drive after password change"
Symptom: "Hi, I changed my password yesterday, and now when I try to open the S:\ drive (Accounting Shared), it pops up asking for credentials and then says:
‘Access Denied: Incorrect username or password’.
I am 100% typing the right password.

Can you check why I can’t access the Accounting shared drive anymore? Others in my department can still access it."
Diagnosis:
  - The user has the right permissions set.
  - The user is not in the correct OU on AD
Action:
  - Confirm the permissions are correct on the shared drive Security (Advanced) and Shared Permissions.
  - Opened AD and located users profile. 
  - Opened Member of tab to confirm user is still a part of accounting OU.
  - Moved user to accounting OU
  - Forced token on users machine with 
    - Invoke-Command -ComputerName SarahPC -ScriptBlock { gpupdate /force }
  - Remapped shared drive on users machine with
    - net use s: /delete
    - net use s: \\fs01\Accounting /persistent:yes
Resolution: "The issue was caused by users account no longer being linked to the Accounting shared drive permissions. I restored the correct group membership and forced an update on users computer."
