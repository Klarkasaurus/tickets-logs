# Ticket Logs

Taking real life IT tickets written in YAML format to simulate real-world helpdesk and sysadmin scenarios.
These are all problems from friends, family and problems I've had myself and resolved.

# Contents
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `tickets_oct_2025.yml` | October troubleshooting logs |
| `tickets_nov_2025.yml` | November troubleshooting logs |

## Purpose
This helps me practice documenting, resolving, and tracking technical issues.
