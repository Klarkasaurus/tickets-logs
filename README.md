# Ticket Logs

Example IT tickets written in YAML format to simulate real-world helpdesk and sysadmin scenarios.

# Contents
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `tickets_oct_2025.yml` | October troubleshooting logs |

## Purpose
This helps me practice documenting, resolving, and tracking technical issues.
