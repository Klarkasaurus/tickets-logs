# Reset trust relationship
Date: "Users can't log into PC"
TicketID: "011"
Title: "Some users can't log into PC this morning"
Symptom/Message: "Hey, we’ve got a weird one — a few people in Accounting said they can’t log into their computers this morning. They’re getting an error that says: “The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed.” I can log into mine fine, but they can’t get past the login screen."
Diagnosis:
  - The trust relationship needed a reset to its machine password with the domain.
Action:
  - Messaged user and explained I would report back once the problem is solved.
  - Confirmed the computers were connected to the network with ping on the server and PC's.
  - Opened Active Directory Users and Account and navigated to the accounting OU to make sure no users were locked out or disabled.
  - Reset the trust relationship from each PC that was not working by running this in powershell
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName "AffectedPC" -ScriptBlock {
	    Reset-ComputerMachinePassword
      }
Resolution: "Ran the PowerShell command to reset each machines password with the domain and confirmed each one was fully operational after the process."
Notes: Note affected machines. If this issue recurs often, it may point to outdated machine accounts, restore from old images, or domain replication delays. Worth monitoring.
Status: "Closed"

# Laptop screen dim
Date: "27-10-2025 17:48"
TicketID: "012"
Title: "My screen is really dim"
Symptom/Message: "Hi, my laptop screen suddenly went really dim this morning. Even when I plug in the charger, it doesn’t brighten up. I tried turning the brightness up with the keys, but it barely changes."
Diagnosis:
  - Outdated display driver affecting brightness control.
Action:
  - Confirmed the power connection was stable and charging.
  - Updated the Display adapter driver in Device mananager.
Resolution: "Updated the display driver. Rebooted the laptop which resolved the problem and is now back to full brightness."
Notes: Check windows power plan first before making changes.
Status: "Closed"

# Network disconnecting
Date: "26-10-2025 18:30"
TicketID: "013"
Title: "My network keeps disconnecting randomly"
Symptom/Message: "Hi, my internet connection keeps dropping out every few minutes. It reconnects after a bit, but it’s really annoying — especially during Teams calls."
Diagnosis:
  - Weak wireless signal due to distance from access point.
Action:
  - Asked to check how many bars the Wi-Fi icon is showing.
  - Asked user how far they are from the access point.
  - Confirmed the signal increased and was stable when moving closer to the access point.
  - Contacted network team to either change the channel to 2.4/5GHz or if it is already on that band then install another access point closer to the office.
Resolution: "Confirmed stable connection when near AP and escalated to Network Team to assess channel/band coverage or add additional AP. Temporary workaround provided by asking the customer to work closer to the access point for now."
Notes: Use "netsh wlan show interfaces". Record what band the Wi-Fi is running on to send to the network team.
Status: "Open: Pending network team action."

# Group policy not applying for users
Date: "30-10-2025 17:13"
TicketID: "014"
Title: "Group policy not applpying for new users"
Symptom/Message: "Hey Klark, we’ve had a few new starters join this week, and it looks like the Group Policy settings aren’t applying properly on their PCs. They’re supposed to get our standard desktop background and mapped drives automatically, but none of those are showing up. Logging off/on doesn’t help."
Diagnosis:
  - The affected users were not in the correct OU which meant they were not using the correct GPO.
Action:
  - Confirmed the affected user from the person reporting the problem.
  - Open Active Directory Users and Computers on Windows Server and checked to see if the users were in the correct OU.
  - Moved the users into the correct OU
  - Confirmed the GPO was set to Enforced by right clicking the GPO in the OU for new users
  - Ran gpupdate /force on each of the affected computers remotely to confirm the GPO was updated and running.
  - Verified settings were applied on each computer.
Resolution: "Issue resolved by moving the affected users into the correct OU in Active Directory."
Notes: "I can make a PowerShell script to check for users not in the correct OU. Do this for next time."
Status: "Closed"

# No sound
Date: "30-10-2025 18:20"
TicketID: "015"
Title: "My sound isn't working"
Symptom/Message: "Hi Klark, I can’t hear anything from my laptop anymore. It was working fine yesterday, but today there’s no sound at all — even on YouTube or Teams."
Diagnosis:
  - The audio output was set to headphones and not speaker.
Actions:
  - Confirmed no changes were made since the problem occurred.
  - Adjusted volume slider which was working correctly.
  - Set the sound output to speakers from Select sound output in volume icon in taskbar.
Resolution: "Changed sound output to speakers from Volume."
