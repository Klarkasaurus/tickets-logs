# Reset trust relationship
Date: "Users can't log into PC"
TicketID: "011"
Title: "Some users can't log into PC this morning"
Symptom/Message: "Hey, we’ve got a weird one — a few people in Accounting said they can’t log into their computers this morning. They’re getting an error that says: “The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed.” I can log into mine fine, but they can’t get past the login screen."
Diagnosis:
  - The trust relationship needed a reset to its machine password with the domain.
Action:
  - Messaged user and explained I would report back once the problem is solved.
  - Confirmed the computers were connected to the network with ping on the server and PC's.
  - Opened Active Directory Users and Account and navigated to the accounting OU to make sure no users were locked out or disabled.
  - Reset the trust relationship from each PC that was not working by running this in powershell
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName "AffectedPC" -ScriptBlock {
	    Reset-ComputerMachinePassword
      }
Resolution: "Ran the PowerShell command to reset each machines password with the domain and confirmed each one was fully operational after the process."
Notes: Note affected machines. If this issue recurs often, it may point to outdated machine accounts, restore from old images, or domain replication delays. Worth monitoring.
